# More methods can include:
    # various assertions
    # putting waits on everything with actions (waiting for element to be present before doing action)
        Ex: assertTap -> waits for element to be clickable before tapping on it
    # different element states (is visible, is enabled) with waits
    # complex chains like TouchActions or ActionChains (drag and drop)
